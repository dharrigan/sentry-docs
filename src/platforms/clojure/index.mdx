On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's Clojure SDK.

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

</Note>

Using a framework? Take a look at our specific guides to get started.

## Install

To add Sentry to your Clojure project, just add a new dependency to your `deps.edn`, `project.clj` or `boot.clj` file, depending upon which package/project manager you are using.

For example, shown below is an example of using `deps.edn` to bring in the dependency:

```clojure
:deps {io.sentry/sentry {:mvn/version "3.2.0"}
       io.sentry/sentry-clj {:mvn/version "3.1.135"}}
```

## Configure

To use the library, simply require the sentry namespace, and initialise the client by passing in a DSN as the first argument, i.e.,

```clojure
(require [sentry-clj.core :as sentry])
(sentry/init! DSN)
```

**Important:** Note your DSN. The DSN (Data Source Name) tells the SDK where to send events. If you forget it, view Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN) in sentry.io.

## Verify Setup

Once initalised, events can be sent to Sentry thus:

```clojure
(sentry/send-event {:message {:message "An event that is sent to Sentry"}}
```

Additional parameters are also supported on the `(sentry/sent-event)` function call,i.e.,

```clojure
(sentry/send-event {:message {:message "An event that is sent to Sentry"
                              :params ["param1" "param2"]
                              :level :error}
                    :throwable (RuntimeException.)})
```

A full list can be found in the source code of `core.clj`.

## Additional Configuration

When initialising the Sentry client, additional configuration can be supplied in an options map to the `(sentry/init!)` function call, i.e.,

```clojure
| key                                  | description                                                                                                        | default
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------
| `:environment`                       | Set the environment on which Sentry events will be logged, e.g., \"production\"                                    | production
| `:debug`                             | Enable SDK logging at the debug level                                                                              | false
| `:release`                           | All events are assigned to a particular release                                                                    |
| `:shutdown-timeout`                  | Wait up to X milliseconds before shutdown if there are events to send                                              | 2000ms
| `:in-app-excludes`                   | A seqable collection (vector for example) containing package names to ignore when sending events                   |
| `:enable-uncaught-exception-handler` | Enables the uncaught exception handler                                                                             | true
| `:before-send-fn`                    | A function (taking an event and a hint)                                                                            |
|                                      | The body of the function must not be lazy (i.e., don't use filter on its own!) and must return an event or nil     |
|                                      | If a nil is returned, the event will not be sent to Sentry                                                         |

| `:before-breadcrumb-fn`              | A function (taking a breadcrumb and a hint)                                                                        |
|                                      | The body of the function must not be lazy (i.e., don't use filter on its own!) and must return a breadcrumb or nil |
|                                      | If a nil is returned, the breadcrumb will not be sent to Sentry                                                    |

## Some futher initialisation examples:

```clojure
(init! \"http://abcdefg@localhost:19000/2\")
```

```clojure
(init! \"http://abcdefg@localhost:19000/2\" {:environment \"production\" :debug true :release \"foo.bar@1.0.0\" :in-app-excludes [\"foo.bar\"])
```

```clojure
(init! \"http://abcdefg@localhost:19000/2\" {:before-send-fn (fn [event _] (when-not (= (.. event getMessage getMessage \"foo\")) event))})
```

```clojure
(init! \"http://abcdefg@localhost:19000/2\" {:before-send-fn (fn [event _] (.setServerName event \"fred\") event)})
```
